Here are the Git commands to create a repository and push your code to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub (https://github.com) and log in to your account.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
   - Provide a repository name and any other desired settings, then click "Create repository".

2. Initialize a local Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add your files to the repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

   This command adds all the files in the current directory to the Git repository. If you want to add specific files, you can specify their names instead of using `.`.

4. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

   This command creates a commit with a commit message. Make sure to provide a meaningful message that describes the changes in this commit.

5. Add the remote repository URL:
   ```
   git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<remote_repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository. It should look like `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`.

6. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   This command pushes the code to the `master` branch of the remote repository on GitHub. If you have a different branch you want to push, replace `master` with the branch name.

7. Enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token) when prompted to complete the push.

After executing these commands, your code will be pushed to the GitHub repository, and you can view it on the corresponding GitHub page.
